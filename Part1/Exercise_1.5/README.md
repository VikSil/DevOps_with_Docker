## [Assignment](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-3#exercises-15---16)

> **EXERCISE 1.5: SIZES OF IMAGES**
> 
> In the [Exercise 1.3](https://github.com/VikSil/DevOps_with_Docker/blob/trunk/Part1/Exercise_1.3) we used `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu.`
> 
> Here is the same application but instead of Ubuntu is using Alpine Linux: `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine`.
> 
> Pull both images and compare the image sizes. Go inside the Alpine container and make sure the secret message functionality is the same. Alpine version doesn't have `bash` but it has `sh`, a more bare-bones shell.
